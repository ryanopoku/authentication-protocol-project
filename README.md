README FILE FOR RYAN OPOKU QMUL PROJECT SUBMISSION

INTRODUCTION
------------
The following readme file is submitted as part of the MSc Computing and Information Systems project component.

The application developed is a user logging in and registration system built using Python Script, which allows a user to create an account, login to that account and stores these information into an external SQLite 3 based database. Once an account is created, a user enters their username and memorable word that they selected when they registered, and then to fully authenticate themselves, they must enter a 12 digit One time Password that has been emailed to their email that they provided. A user can√ït login until these 12 character one time password has been entered.

It is not possible to include an executable exe file, therefore source code consisting of the python file, that can be executed with the Microsoft Visual Studio interpreter is included.
